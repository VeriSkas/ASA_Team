                        In order for a life to survive in today's world, it is important that we regularly
                        review what we are doing and how we are doing it. By considering new ideas and new
                        ways of doing things, and trying to innovate, we can improve on our products/services,
                        increase sales, reduce costs and make our processes more effective and efficient.
                        Innovation is key to increasing profits.
                        How effective is your to-do list? Does it help you plan your day? Does it nudge you to
                        prioritize the right tasks? Or is it a never-ending list of things you feel guilty for
                        not having done yet and now you're not going to do any of them?
                        A good to-do list should serve you. You should not be at its mercy.
                        A practical to-do list sets you off in the right direction each day and helps you focus
                        on the tasks that are most important to you. With the right strategies, a to-do list can
                        help you achieve larger goals, too.
                        When a new task pops into your head, write it on your to-do list as quickly as possible.
                        Adding tasks as soon as you think of them prevents you from dwelling on them. Once it's
                        written down, you don't need to remember it anymore.
                        Our app is  a versatile product for creative, dynamic and focused people. An easy-to-use
                        organizer for quickly jotting down your ideas, plans and other notes
                        What is behind this expression?
                        We tried to put importance into this abbreviation. In our understanding, "DO IT" is a motivation
                        for action. As we remember, there is an expression of the Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu: "Even a
                        path of a thousand li begins with the first step." Our application is that very important first
                        step. The step that starts with the initial task (I.T - Initial Task).
